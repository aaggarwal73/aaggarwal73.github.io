## My First Post - The Start of My Trip (before I've left)

As I sit here, I realize that I have researched quite a bit and found a lot of helpful lists on different websites that help to understand what a packing list for Europe looks like. I sit here and think about how many ways that people who I don't know took time out of their day to help provide tips on their travel and how, even if the information was regurgitated, it was extremely helpful. I sit here thinking all this and procrastinating finishing cleaning my room and actually packing. 

I wanted to talk about the things that I found that was helpful and provide a reflection that I will update at the end of my trip. 

I believe it'll be more helpful to you if you understand my mindset going into this trip and the person I am so here's a little bit about me. I am a recent college graduate going on a trip for about two months to celebrate with friends, explore and learn about myself, and visit family. My mindset going into this trip is that I want to push myself and challenge myself to grow as an individual. I struggle with going into things without a plan (even though I'm an orange for those true colors fans), I struggle with being alone (extrovert problems, amiright?), and I struggle putting myself in front of strangers and not caring about what they think.  

## Tips for packing

1. It takes longer than you think - you probably know this but I always underestimate the time it takes to pack a backpack
2. Order everything at least a week in advance. I thought of stuff to order the day of and was somewhat out of luck 
3. Don't panic about forgetting something - I did this way too much - but you'll be fine without the luxries of the perfect trip... relax - everything almost always works out (probably cursed because I said this but worth it).
