Some information about me!

### Who am I? 

As I became involved in an orgnaization my first year at Georgia Tech, I learned that the "why" makes a person great. A great product can appeal to the tangible side, but unless someone believes in the product, it will never get momentum. My "Why" has to do with access. As a child of immigrant parents, I am aware of the discrepancy of resources available to me and other people my age around the world. My hope is to develop technology to the point where everyone in the world is exposed to resources and opportunities that might otherwise be unimaginable. Simply put, I want to help establish a base level of resources to allow others to reach their full potential. 

### More Information

I'm a Fourth Year Computer Science Major at Georgia Tech and am looking forward to starting my career at Qualtrics this August. Stay tuned for updates with my travel life, my thoughts on leadership, and my thoughts on life.
